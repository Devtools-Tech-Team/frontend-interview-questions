# frontend-interview-questions

This repo contains programming questions asked in Frontend interviews.

1. [DOM API Interview Question](https://github.com/Devtools-Tech-Team/frontend-interview-questions/blob/main/dom-api-question.js)

    In this question, we will implement a code snippet where we will create our own abstractions similar to DOM APIs. We will go through and understand APIs like `createElement`, `appendChild`, and implement things from ground up.
